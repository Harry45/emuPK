3D Matter Power Spectrum
------------------------

The emulation procedure can be broken down into multiple different steps. The goal is to generate both the 3D matter power spectrum and the different weak lensing power spectra. Hence we have multiple layers, which incvolve generating the important quantities from CLASS (the forward simulations) and we also require the redshift distribution. To be more generic, we also allow the calculation of the 3D matter power spectrum using CLASS as an option.
